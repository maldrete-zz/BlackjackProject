## BlackJack Project

Week 5 Homework for skill Distillery

## Overview
This program models the card game blackjack. 
Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack


## How to play

## Technologies Used
Building classes in an Object-oriented manner, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation. Used lists, constructors, for and while loops, if statements, and try catch blocks.

## Lessons Learned
Getting comfortable with use of multiple classes inheritance and applying child parent relationships within the classes in order to access methods. I found this project challenging in the aspect of learning inheritance and running multiple conditions in BlackJackApp to check if the user or dealer had won while allowing the players to hit for more cards. I wrote most of the code in BlackJackApp in a method called launch. Looking back, I am realizing I should have created a more concrete UML diagram so that as I continued writing code I would be able to write out some of the code in methods instead of writing each line by line when it could have been refenced in method. I tend to write some code and see if it works then write more code and run into an issue. During this time when an issue arises I need take out my UML map and access if this problem will also be an issue for future code so that I may fix the UML diagram and fix this problem once instead of running into the same or similar problems multiple times.
